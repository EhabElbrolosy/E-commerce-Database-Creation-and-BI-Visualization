# E-commerce-Database-Creation-and-BI-Visualization
In this project, I developed a relational database using PostgreSQL from the scratch to simulate an E-commerce environment.
I created and populated multiple interconnected tables with sample data to reflect realistic business scenarios. To ensure a clear understanding of the database structure, I developed an Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram that mapped out table relationships and cardinality.
I then wrote and executed a variety of SQL queries to extract actionable insights, such as customer purchasing behavior, sales trends, and product performance.
Finally, I connected the PostgreSQL database to Power BI and built an interactive dashboard that visualized key performance indicators and allowed for dynamic filtering and exploration of the data.
